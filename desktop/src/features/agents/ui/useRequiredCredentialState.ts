/**
 * Compute the runtime/provider-required credential state and keep the Advanced
 * section's required-credential row visible when a key is newly missing.
 *
 * All keys are derived from the PROSPECTIVE post-submit runtime (not the
 * current dropdown). On an inherit transition (claude→buzz-agent or the
 * reverse) the current dropdown would suppress the provider to "" and falsely
 * unblock Save; using the prospective id keeps the gate honest about what will
 * actually be saved.
 *
 * The `EnvVarsEditor` (and its amber required-key row) lives inside the
 * collapsed-by-default Advanced section, so a provider change that newly
 * requires a key would otherwise leave the row unmounted while Save is disabled
 * with no on-screen reason. This hook auto-expands Advanced on the
 * missing→present-requirement transition, so the user can still collapse it
 * again once the key is filled.
 *
 * `globalProvider` is used as the fallback when the per-agent provider is
 * empty — without it, a global-provider-only config produces no required keys
 * in the agent-instance dialogs even though the effective provider demands one.
 *
 * `globalEnvVars` is used to satisfy credential keys at the global layer:
 * a key present in global env is NOT required (no amber row, save not blocked).
 * This mirrors the same agent→global→file precedence used by
 * `computeLocalModeGate`. Without it, a key covered only by global env still
 * marks `requiredEnvKeyMissing=true` and silently disables Save.
